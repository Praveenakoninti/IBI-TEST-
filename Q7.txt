7.Use Array.reduce() method to reverse the following given array

const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

You can use the Array.reduce() method to reverse the given array as follows:
const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

const reversedArr = arr.reduce((accumulator, currentValue) => {
  return [currentValue, ...accumulator];
}, []);

console.log(reversedArr); // Output: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
In the reduce() method, we start with an empty array [] as the initial value for the accumulator. Then, for each element in 
the original array, we create a new array with the current element at the beginning followed by the existing accumulator elements. 
This effectively reverses the order of elements, and the final result is the reversed array [5, 4, 3, 2, 1].
