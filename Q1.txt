1. What are the differences between cookie, local storage and session storage
The HTTP protocol is one of the most important protocols for smooth communication between the server and the client. 
The main disadvantage of the HTTP protocol it is a stateless protocol that means it does not track any kind of information 
of response and request by the server and the client, So in order to resolve this problem, there are three ways to track .
Cookies:
-Cookies are small pieces of data stored as text files on the user's browser .
-They are primarily used for client-side storage of small amounts of data (usually limited to 4KB).
-Cookies are sent to the server with every HTTP request, which can increase the data overhead.
-They can have an expiration date, meaning they can persist for a specified duration or remain 
until the user clears their browser data.
-Cookies can be set with specific domain and path restrictions.
-They can be used for tracking user behavior, session management, and remembering user preferences.
-It is supported by all the browser including older browser.

Local Storage:

-Local storage is a part of the Web Storage API and allows developers to store larger amounts of data (usually limited to 5-10MB) compared to cookies.
-The data is stored as key-value pairs directly in the user's browser.
Unlike cookies, local storage data is not sent to the server with each HTTP request, reducing data overhead.
-The data in local storage remains even after the browser is closed and persists across sessions, unless explicitly cleared by the user or through code.
-Local storage is useful for applications that require to store user settings, cache data, or maintain state between visits.
Session Storage:


-Like local storage, session storage is also part of the Web Storage API and provides a similar storage mechanism.
-The storage capacity of session storage is 5MB.
-The key difference is that session storage data is cleared when the user closes the browser or the current tab, effectively limited to the current browsing session.
-Session storage is useful when you need to store temporary data that should be discarded after the user leaves the website or closes the tab.
