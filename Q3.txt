3What is Sharding in MongoDB, and how does it work?
Sharding in MongoDB is a data partitioning technique used to distribute data across multiple servers or shards. It helps to horizontally scale a MongoDB database, accommodating large volumes of data and high write/read workloads. Each shard holds a subset of the data, and the process is transparent to the application. MongoDB's balancer redistributes data across shards to maintain an even distribution. Sharding is based on a sharding key, which determines how data is distributed across shards. As the data grows, new shards can be added, allowing the system to scale dynamically and handle increased traffic and storage requirements.
The mongos acts as a query router for client applications, handling both read and write operations. It dispatches client requests to the relevant shards and aggregates the result from shards into a consistent client response. Clients connect to a mongos, not to individual shards.
Config servers are the authoritative source of sharding metadata. The sharding metadata reflects the state and organization of the sharded data. The metadata contains the list of sharded collections, routing information, etc.
